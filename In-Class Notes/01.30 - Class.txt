Project Idea:
• weather forecasting app

- 3rd party API
- 5 day forecast
- current weather
- location based
- user input
- user interface
- user friendly


• Data Sceince Lifecycle

question formulation
data aquisition and clenaing
exploratory data analysis
prediction and future

What do we want to tknoe or what problems are we trying to solve

what are our hypothesis

what are our metrics of success

 • obtain data

 what data do we have and what data do we need?

 • understand the data

 do we already have relevant data?

 what are the bisases, anomalies, or other issues with the data

 ## flat table

 • Understand the world

 what does the data say about the world

 does it answer oir questions oer accuralety solve the prolbem

 how robust are our conclusions

 ## meta data

 ## data science comes to protecting the hypothesis and working with the data (and making it work for the problem)


 • SAMPLING

 how can we draw conclusions about a large population using small samples

 quota sampling 1948

 - population (size N)
 - sampling frame
 - sample (a subset of the sample frame)

 • censys (a sample covers the entire population)

 • Administrative Data (sample covers entire sampling frame but not the population)

• ideal random sample (sampling frame is the population and the sample is random)

• typical sample in practice (sampling frame partially overlaps with the populatios)

• ACCURACY

in data science we use large and diverse data sets to make conclusions about the world

low variance & high bias - worst scenario

## essentially all models are wrong, btu some are useful

A model is an idealized representation of a system

• the Constant Model
what's the simplest model, one that always makes the same prediction


mathematically, theta(x) = 0

while this model is simple, training it is challenging

• code for histogram

sns.histplot(data, bins=20, kde=True);

tTo quantify how good an estimate is, we will use loss functions.
A loss function
▶ takes in an estimator Θ and the points in our dataset, y1,y2,...,yn, and
▶ outputs a single #, the loss, that measures how well Θ fits the data.
The choice of loss function affects the downstream analysis.
