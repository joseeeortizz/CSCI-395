# Classwork
This page contains information about the in-lecture exercises.


Your submitted files must have a multi-line string header like so (replace values with your own!):

```python
"""
Name: Adri√°n Soto
Email: adrian.soto@hunter.cuny.edu (IMPORTANT: use your Gradescope email!!)
Pod: {1st left, 2nd left, ... 4th right, 5th right}
"""
```


### Submitting `.py` scripts
The autograder will attempt to import objects from your script. If you're submitting a `.py` script, any _executed_ code must be inside a main code block like this:

```python
# imports, function definitions etc. go here
# ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # your executed code goes here
    # ...
```


### Submitting `.ipynb` notebooks
Info on this later...
