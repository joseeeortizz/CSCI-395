This assignment focuses on geospatial data analysis and on maps.

You will be using [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Start off from `program3-template.ipynb`; you will find instructions to the assignment within. Your objective is to complete the requested "tasks". Most of them are programming steps to guide you throughout an analysis of the main question, and other ones are qualitative questions to help you reason about your findings.

You must submit a file called `program3.ipynb` into Gradescope. The grading rubric is

```
Section 1: 25 points
Section 2: 25 points
Section 3: 25 points
Section 4: 25 points
```
The assignments will be graded _after_ the due date. 

Make sure to be on python 3.9 or higher. A list of the required libraries for this assignment can be found them in `requirements.txt`.
