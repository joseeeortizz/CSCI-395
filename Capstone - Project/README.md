# Capstone project

Your capstone projects should either utilize the skills and tools you acquired during the course or go beyond them with materials you've learned on your own. This is your chance to demonstrate what you know (or are capable of learning), your creativity, and your communication skills in a project that you are passionate about. Your project should be **original**.
 
Throughout your project, from design to delivery, you will find the "[data science lifecycle](https://learningds.org/ch/01/lifecycle_cycle.html)" we discussed in the lectures a useful framework.

### Milestone #1: Project proposal
#### Format
Your main proposal document must be a jupyter notebook. Use markdown cells to write text and to include any images or hyperlinks you'd like to share.

You can additionally include any other files that you might need, such as a custom python package, a sqlite file, or a sample data file.

#### Content
Your project proposal should be broken down in the following sections

1. Title
2. Overview 
2. Background
3. Data sources
4. Analysis
5. Product

##### Title
The title should capture the topic/theme of your project. Feel free to make it catchy!

##### Overview
Think of the overview section as the equivalent of an abstract in a research paper or an elevator pitch for the project. This section should succinctly convey why your project is important, what problem/question is solving/answering, and how it fits into the bigger picture or context in to which it pertains. A short paragraph or two should be enough.

##### Background
In this section is where you should prove that you've already done research in the project you are proposing. Introduce any context and terminology that is relevant to the project, expand on the problem you're solving for, and introduce any literature or resources on the matter that you've found in your research.

##### Data sources
Your project should be anchored on a set of data used in your work. You **must use publicly available data**. It can be either from curated, publicly available datsets, or from results of your own data scraping.

##### Exploratory analysis
After obtaining your data, please make sure you perform exploratory analysis so you can feel confident you have the right data to answer the questions you wish to explore.

Make sure to provide a summary of the data in the proposal through charts and tables, as well as text explaining your conclusions.


##### Product
In this section you will outline the vision for your solution and you will demonstrate that you're equipped to deliver it. Whether you'd like to build an interactive dashboard, a journalistic data report, or a deep neural network, in this section you will break down the most relevant steps of your product as well as test out that the libraries and packages you'll be using are working as you expect them too. Think of it as the "Hello, world!" of your product.

### Milestone #2: Draft check-in
This will be an opportunity for us to check in on progress and to troubleshoot any potential issues you may have encountered as your work is underway. More details to come as we get closer to check-in week.

### Milestone #3: Project submission
More details to come as we approach the submission deadline.

### Milestone #4: Lightning talk
Oral presentations are a very important skill in data science. Your audience for your project are your classmates, but potentially also tech recruiters and future employers. 

More details to come.


## Example project ideas
Remember that your project should be **original**: you need to come up with your own. But to provide you with some guidance, here are few example ideas that would fit really nicely in this course's scope.

##### Idea 1: Is residential real estate in NYC a good personal investment?
It's been believed for decades that investing in a home, and in NYC in particular, is a good idea for individuals and families: property values always go up in the long term, and capital investments (such as renovations) can boost the value of the property. Is that still true today?

This project would gather data from several official data sources on property values, interest rates, tax rates, renovation costs, etc. to analyze under which conditions investing in NYC real estate could be a good financial idea for an individual or a family today.


##### Idea 2: Is the mayor's pro-development initiative well-founded?
According to the NYC Department of Housing and Development's "Housing and Vacancy Survey" (NYCHVS) NYC housing supply has reached in early 2024 a historic low of 1.4%. According to the NYC administration, this is causing a hard housing market with extremely high rental costs. However, according to demographic data, NYC has lost approximately 500,000 residents since the beginning of the pandemic. How is this possible?

This project would investigate this apparent contradiction, dig up data from disparate sources to write a report with a compelling explanation.


##### Idea 3: The Toll of War
It is well known that the Second World War was the deadliest conflict in human history. None of the recent and current conflicts around the world is at that scale in terms of absolute number of fatalities. But how do they compare across other dimensions? Can we conclude anything about the overall trends?

This project would focus on data visualization and storytelling. Engaging visuals would be a key part of this project.

##### Idea 4: Predicting NYC Restaurant Inspection Results
NYC restaurants are inspected frequently by the health authorities. Knowing which restaurants have a high probability of receiving a high (or a low) grade would be useful to customers, restaurant owners, and the NYC administration.

This project would build predictive models to determine how accurately inspection outcomes can be predicted, find patterns (if any), and explore potential pitfalls of this modeling approach.

## Project submission
Please submit your project into this repository. Push your code into a new branch containing a first and last name, create a pull request, and assign it to me.

Avoid uploading really large files to the repository, especially your  data files. Instead, provide references to the data sources in your README, your notebook(s), or elsewhere.

## Lightning talk

Talks will be 5 minutes, with 1 minute for questions + getting the next speaker ready. The presentation slides must be submitted **in PDF format** by Tuesday, May 13 10 at 5:00pm via email at adrian.soto@hunter.cuny.edu using the subject line "CAPSTONE PRESENTATION SLIDES".
